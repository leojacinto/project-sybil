# Travel Request App - Approach Comparison

> **Pilot / Demo only.** This repo compares how AI-assisted approaches perform when building on ServiceNow, and what platform-native tooling unlocks. The Travel Request app is intentionally simple, it exists to benchmark tooling, not to ship. None of these approaches nor their outcomes are production-grade.

---

## The Journey

An external AI agent (Claude Opus via Cascade) tried three paths to build a Travel Request app on ServiceNow. First, raw REST API calls to create a custom UI page; it worked, but took ~2 hours and 4 failed iterations to land on a UI pattern that ServiceNow would render. Second, the same REST approach to build a native workspace; the workspace framework coordinates ~20 records across multiple tables, which is purpose-built for platform-native tooling rather than external REST calls. Third, the ServiceNow SDK (`now-sdk`) with Fluent TypeScript, it deployed the entire data foundation (table, business rules, ACLs, sample data) in ~18 minutes from a single prompt, and the SDK's `Workspace` Fluent API successfully deployed a workspace that REST could not. The custom UI page and dashboard still required further iteration.

Then ServiceNow's own Build Agent attempted the same deliverables from inside the platform. It delivered a working custom UI from a single prompt in ~20 minutes and a full workspace in 5 prompts under 15 minutes.

**Building the data foundation is easy for any AI agent. The UI is the hard part.** Even with the right external tooling, delivering a cohesive working UI from outside ServiceNow requires significant iteration or hits a wall entirely. Build Agent operates natively where it matters most.

## 1. Cost & Time

| | **Approach 1** | **Approach 2** | **Approach 3** | **Approach 4** | **Approach 5** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Model** | Claude Opus | Claude Opus | Claude Opus | Build Agent | Build Agent |
| **Effort** | ~12,000 Cascade tokens | ~15,000+ Cascade tokens | ~20,000 Cascade tokens (1 prompt + 9 fixes) | 27 assists, 70+ tool calls | 5 prompts, 62 tool calls |
| **Wall-clock** | ~2 hours | ~3 hours (incomplete) | ~20 minutes | ~20 minutes | < 15 minutes |
| **Iterations** | 4 failed, then working | 3 pivots, still no workspace | 4 build fixes + 2 deploy fixes + 3 runtime fixes | First run worked | First run worked |
| **Outcome** | Working Jelly UI Page | Components only | Workspace deployed, custom UI + dashboard still incomplete | Working React UI Page | Full workspace + dashboard |

> **Note on units.** Cascade (Approaches 1-3) is measured in tokens or prompt/fix cycles because it operates through an LLM coding assistant. Build Agent (Approaches 4-5) is measured in prompts and tool calls because it operates through a conversational UI inside ServiceNow. These are not directly comparable, but both reflect total effort to reach a working app.

**Where the time went: the UI.** Data model creation (table, fields, business rules) was fast in every approach; minutes, not hours. The cost difference was always in the UI layer:

- **Approach 1 (REST Custom UI):** 4 failed iterations over ~2 hours. UI Pages require Jelly XML with server-side `<g:evaluate>` blocks, CSRF tokens, and form POST writes, patterns that are not obvious from the REST API surface.
- **Approach 2 (REST Workspace):** The workspace framework coordinates ~20 records across multiple tables, purpose-built for platform-native tooling. External REST API calls are not the intended path for workspace assembly.
- **Approach 3 (SDK Custom UI):** The SDK deployed the entire data foundation from a single prompt in ~18 minutes (table, 4 business rules, 4 ACLs, app menu, 5 sample records). But the SDK-bundled UI page could not load records at runtime, the client-side REST calls required additional cross-scope configuration beyond the SDK's default scaffold.
- **Approaches 4-5 (Build Agent):** Working apps in under 20 minutes each. No iterations. No auth issues. No CSRF debugging. No SDK type mismatches. Build Agent operates inside ServiceNow where UI rendering, workspace assembly, and business rule wiring are native operations.

## 3. Iteration Paths

### Approach 1 -- REST API Custom UI (~2 hours)

4 failed iterations before the working version. See [approach-1-rest-custom-ui/](approach-1-rest-custom-ui/).

1. **Raw HTML** -- blank page (UI Pages require Jelly XML)
2. **Client-side XHR** -- 401 (CSRF enforcement on `direct=true` pages)
3. **GlideAjax** -- blocked (cross-scope Script Include access)
4. **Jelly XML partial** -- vars not injecting (`client_script` field not Jelly-processed)
5. **Final: Jelly XML + `<g:evaluate>` + form POST** -- working

### Approach 2 -- REST API Workspace (~3 hours, incomplete)

Cascade produced functional React components (forms, tables, state machine, validation). The workspace framework coordinates ~20 records across multiple tables (`sys_ux_app_config`, `sys_ux_page_registry`, `sys_ux_screen_type`, `sys_ux_app_route`, `sys_ux_screen`, `sys_ux_page_property`). This level of orchestration is purpose-built for platform-native tooling (Build Agent, SDK) rather than external REST calls. See [approach-2-rest-workspace/](approach-2-rest-workspace/).

### Approach 3 -- SDK Custom UI + Workspace (~20 minutes, partial)

Claude Opus scaffolded the full app from a single prompt using the ServiceNow SDK v4.4.0. The data foundation and workspace deployed successfully. The custom UI page and dashboard required additional iterations but could not reach the same level as Build Agent. See [approach-3-sdk/](approach-3-sdk/).

1. **Initial scaffold** -- build failed (SDK bundler expected `<script src="./app.ts">` entry point)
2. **Restructured to client app** -- build failed (15 type errors: `PriceColumn` missing, `ChoiceColumn` format wrong, `ReferenceColumn` uses `referenceTable`, `BusinessRule` uses `action` array, `Module` missing)
3. **Fixed types** -- build failed (`DecimalColumn` requires numbers, not strings)
4. **Fixed numbers** -- build succeeded
5. **First deploy** -- failed (SDK needs `sys_app` record, not `sys_scope`)
6. **Created sys_app** -- deploy succeeded
7. **UI Page loaded** -- stats and table render, but REST API calls return no data (CSRF enforcement on `direct=true` pages, no `g_ck` token available)
8. **Added Scripted REST API** -- created server-side GlideRecord API via `RestApi` Fluent to bypass CSRF. Custom UI still did not load data correctly.
9. **Added Workspace** -- `Workspace` + `UxListMenuConfig` Fluent APIs deployed a native workspace with 4 list views. Workspace loaded successfully.
10. **Added Dashboard** -- `Dashboard` Fluent API deployed 8 widgets (single-score cards, donut, bar chart). Dashboard did not display correctly on instance.

**Deployed artifacts:** table (extends task), 8 fields, 4 business rules, 4 ACLs, application menu, 5 sample records, Scripted REST API, bundled UI page, workspace with list config, dashboard with 8 widgets.

**What worked:** The SDK's `Workspace` Fluent API successfully orchestrated the ~20 `sys_ux_*` records that REST could not practically assemble. The workspace appeared and list views functioned. The data foundation deployed cleanly from a single prompt.

**What didn't:** The custom UI page required additional iteration for data loading (CSRF token handling, Scripted REST API). The Dashboard Fluent API deployed widgets but they required further configuration. The UI layer is where platform-native tooling has the strongest advantage.

## 4. Platform Behaviors Encountered (External Route)

| # | Behavior | Approach | External limitation? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | UI Pages require Jelly XML, not raw HTML | 1 | Yes (discoverable) |
| 2 | CSRF enforcement on `direct=true` pages | 1 | No (expected security) |
| 3 | `client_script` field not Jelly-processed | 1 | Yes (discoverable) |
| 4 | Workspace coordinates ~20 `sys_ux_*` records (purpose-built for native tooling) | 2 | No (by design) |
| 5 | `sys_ux_screen` linkage to OOB macroponents required | 2 | No (by design) |
| 6 | SDK Fluent API types required adjustments for v4.4.0 compatibility | 3 | Yes (discoverable) |
| 7 | SDK bundler requires `<script src>` entry point | 3 | Yes (discoverable) |
| 8 | `now-sdk install` requires `sys_app`, not `sys_scope` | 3 | Yes (discoverable) |
| 9 | SDK-bundled UI Page (`direct=true`) has no `g_ck` token for CSRF-protected REST calls | 3 | Yes (platform security) |
| 10 | Scripted REST API via SDK Fluent still did not resolve custom UI data loading | 3 | Yes (additional iteration) |
| 11 | SDK `Workspace` Fluent API deployed workspace successfully (abstracted ~20 `sys_ux_*` records) | 3 | No (SDK handled it) |
| 12 | SDK `Dashboard` Fluent API deployed but widgets did not render correctly | 3 | Yes (widget config gap) |

Items #1-3 and #6-10, #12 are friction points for external agents that Build Agent avoids by operating natively. Items #4-5 reflect workspace orchestration that is purpose-built for platform-native tooling (Build Agent, SDK). Item #11 shows the SDK closing the gap for workspace creation.

## 5. Bottom Line

**The data foundation is easy. The UI is the hard part.**

Every approach, REST, SDK, or Build Agent, created the data model (table, fields, business rules) quickly. The differentiator is delivering a **cohesive, working UI** that users actually interact with.

| | Data foundation | Working UI |
|---|---|---|
| **Approach 1** (REST Custom UI) | Minutes | ~2 hours (4 iterations) |
| **Approach 2** (REST Workspace) | Minutes | Incomplete (not the intended path) |
| **Approach 3** (SDK Custom UI + Workspace) | ~20 minutes (1 prompt + 9 fixes) | Workspace deployed, custom UI + dashboard still incomplete |
| **Approach 4** (Build Agent Custom UI) | Minutes | ~20 minutes (1 prompt, zero fixes) |
| **Approach 5** (Build Agent Workspace) | Minutes | < 15 minutes (5 prompts, zero fixes) |

The SDK (Approach 3) closed the gap significantly over raw REST (Approaches 1-2). The `Workspace` Fluent API successfully deployed a native workspace, the SDK is purpose-built for this. The custom UI page and dashboard required further iteration to reach parity with Build Agent. Build Agent delivered both custom UI and workspace on the first attempt because it operates natively where it matters most, the UI layer.

The AI models are equally capable. The variable is what each agent can reach from where it operates.
