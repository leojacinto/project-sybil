# Project Sybil: Travel Request App Specification

> The original Sybil benchmark used a deliberately simple Travel Request app to compare vibe coding approaches. This expanded specification covers **every scoped application component type** to serve as the definitive build brief for future Sybil iterations.

**Scope name:** `x_demo_travel`
**App name:** Travel Request Management
**Use case:** Employees submit travel requests with destination, dates, estimated costs, and purpose. Managers approve or reject. Finance reviews high-cost requests. Travelers log expenses post-trip. The app tracks budget compliance per department.

## 7. Flows (Workflow Automation)

### Flow: Travel Request Approval
**Trigger:** Record updated on x_demo_travel_request where approval_status changes to Pending

**Steps:**
1. **Lookup** active delegation record for traveler's manager
2. **If** delegation exists and is within date range: set approver = delegate. **Else:** set approver = traveler's manager
3. **Ask for Approval** from the resolved approver
4. **If Approved:** update approval_status to Approved
5. **If Rejected:** update approval_status to Rejected, add journal entry with rejection reason
6. **If** estimated_cost > policy threshold: update approval_status to Finance Review, trigger subflow Finance Escalation

### Subflow: Finance Escalation
**Input:** travel_request sys_id
1. **Ask for Approval** from users with x_demo_travel.finance role
2. **If Approved:** update approval_status to Approved
3. **If Rejected:** update approval_status to Rejected

### Flow: Expense Reimbursement
**Trigger:** Record created on x_demo_travel_expense
1. **If** amount > max_daily threshold from policy for expense_type: flag for manual finance review
2. **Else:** auto-approve and update reimbursement_status to Approved

## Notes

- The app is intentionally feature-complete but domain-simple. It exists to benchmark tooling, not to ship as a production travel system.
- Every component type from the ServiceNow scoped application inventory is exercised at least once.
- The Scripted REST API enables external consumption testing (relevant for Sybil Approaches 1-3).
- Seed data ensures the app is immediately demonstrable after deployment.
- Connection aliases are used for external connections to support promotion across instances without credential exposure.
